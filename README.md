# PythonREST_UC2015
iPython notebook for Python and REST Esri UC 2015 session


This session will explore some of the best practices and workflows for using Python to interact with RESTful services. Through the integration of Python with ArcGIS for Server, ArcGIS for Portal and ArcGIS Online, you can perform a wide variety of administrative and querying functions over REST. Weâ€™ll explore how to authenticate a connection, make requests, parse JSON, and work with the response.
